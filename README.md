# Speech Emotion Detection using Deep Learning 

## Project Overview
The Speech Emotion Detection project aims to classify speech into different emotional states by analyzing audio features. Using deep learning, the project converts speech signals into histograms and leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification. The model can identify emotions such as neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised from speech recordings.

## Project Objective
To develop a deep learning-based speech emotion recognition system.

To classify speech into eight different emotional categories.

To convert speech signals into histograms for feature extraction.

To improve human-computer interaction and emotion-aware applications.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python – Programming Language

Librosa – Audio Processing & Feature Extraction

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep Learning Framework

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) – Model Architecture

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Model Training & Experimentation

## Dataset

## Model Workflow
Audio Preprocessing – Noise reduction, feature extraction using Mel spectrograms.

Histogram Conversion – Transforming extracted features into histogram representations.

CNN-Based Classification – Training the deep learning model.

Evaluation – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction – Classifying new speech samples into respective emotions.

Did these processses with predefined models like VGG19,VGG16,InceptionV3,Resnet50 and compared the results with our proposed model.

## Key Insights
Speech signals can be effectively classified into emotions using histograms.

The CNN model achieves high accuracy in emotion recognition.

The project can be applied to AI assistants, call centers, and mental health monitoring.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in emotion recognition by analyzing speech characteristics. It offers practical applications in sentiment analysis, AI-driven customer support, and mental health assessment.
